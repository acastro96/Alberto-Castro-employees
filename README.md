## 🧠 Solution Overview

The application allows a user to:

1. Upload a CSV file containing employee-project-date information.
2. Validate that data client-side (including date formats and required columns).
3. Normalize the data and send it to the backend.
4. Process that data to calculate the employee pair that has worked the most days together.
5. Display the result in a responsive and styled data grid.
